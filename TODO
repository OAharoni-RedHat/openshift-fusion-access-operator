- Figure out in which namespace the operator should be installed (don't think using the default 'openshift-operators' is best practice these days)
- Create spectrum cluster object with some sane worker label default (if there are no nodes with the label, exposed via CRD, then do nothing)
- Rewrite create-rbacs.sh in golang and add some unit tests/validation as it will become more important in the future
- For the MachineConfig bits do we want to drop all these modules and just render a yaml template and use manifestival?
- Add tweaks so you can create a single purplestorage object (maybe via some admission webhook)
- Lookup the openshift clusterversion and check it against the ibm spectrum version hash table (in admission webhook or also in the reconcile loop)
- Make sure that the operator is disconnected and fips compliant
- Can we export IBM GPFS stuff through events from the start or performance metrics through the native openshift bits?
- In the UI add that warning that you must create the PurpleStorage singleton object
- Think of what fields will be immutable in our CR (list of cluster nodes maybe?)
- Tweak our ansible scripts to use the operator
- Get to 100% unit testing

[DONE]
