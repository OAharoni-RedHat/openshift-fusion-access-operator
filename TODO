- Figure out in which namespace the operator should be installed (don't think using the default 'opernshift-operators' is best practice these days)
- Rewrite create-rbacs.sh in golang and add some unit tests/validation as it will become more important in the future
- For the MachineConfig bits do we want to drop all these modules and just render a yaml template and use manifestival?
